## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-19

### Added
- **Multi-Resolution Mixed Training Support**: Complete implementation of mixed resolution training capabilities
  - Support for training with multiple resolution candidates in a single training session
  - Intelligent resolution selection based on original image aspect ratio
  - Two configuration formats: Simple list mode (shared across all images) and Advanced dict mode (per-image-type configuration)
  - Automatic aspect ratio preservation with configurable maximum aspect ratio limit
  - Dynamic pixel-based target selection from candidate resolutions
  - Example configuration at `tests/test_configs/test_example_fluxkontext_multiresolution.yaml`

### Changed
- **Data Processing Enhancement**: Extended `ImageProcessor` with multi-resolution mode support
  - New `multi_resolutions` configuration parameter supporting list or dict formats
  - `_parse_multi_resolution_config()` method for parsing resolution candidates
  - `_select_pixels_candidate()` method for intelligent resolution selection
- **Configuration Schema**: Added `multi_resolutions` field to `ImageProcessorInitArgs`
  - Supports simple list format: `["1024*1024", "512*512"]` (applies to all images)
  - Supports advanced dict format: `{target: [...], controls: [[...], [...]]}`
  - Includes configurable `max_aspect_ratio` parameter for aspect ratio constraints

### Technical Details
- Resolution candidates are parsed from string expressions (e.g., "512*512") or integers
- Aspect ratio-aware selection ensures optimal resolution choice for each input
- Compatible with all existing training modes (single control, multi-control)
- Works seamlessly with cache system, quantization, and all supported model architectures
- Full backward compatibility: existing configs without `multi_resolutions` continue to work unchanged

### Breaking Changes
- None - This is a backwards-compatible addition. Existing configurations without `multi_resolutions` will function exactly as before.
